When the sun goes up, when the sun goes down
It's been six days now with insomnia
Try to touch my skin but I feel nothing
I just think of you, don't know what to do

Clock is ticking out and I hear the sound
Like an empty soul playing all day long
And I move my feet but I feel nothing
I pretend to smile but I cry inside
